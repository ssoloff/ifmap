[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-link]

Interactive fiction mapping utility.

## Development Environment

### JDK

IFMap currently targets Java 6.  To avoid incompatible boot classpath warnings during compilation, JDK 6 must be available during the build.  Define the project property `JDK6_HOME` to point to the location of your local JDK 6 installation using any of the methods described [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html).
